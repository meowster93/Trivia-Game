# Trivia-Game
homework stuff
stuff that still needs done to have a completed functioning game. 

I still need to properly display ALL of my questions after the start button is clicked and initiates timer.
I need to add a selector property to allow player to choose a answer.
I will then use an if and if else statement to display proper picture and "correct" or "no the correct answer" responses.
  then set a timeout function to that before moving onto nextphase function.
I need to have functions which add properly to score bord, probably use an if statement.
I need to create a if statement for when I get to last question not to go to nextphase but perhaps a new function(create a new function)
new function will be endResultsScoreBoard which will end timer display the score from the game.
Displaying the score board I will also want to create a button to start the game over clearing the previous game and starting the game over.
